# Muslim Abaya — Support Chat Setup

## What is in this implementation

- `support-chat.js` keeps the storefront widget and WhatsApp/Messenger fallbacks, and adds Supabase anonymous sign-in, per-customer conversations, saved messages, quick-action audit events and a Realtime listener.
- `admin-support-inbox.html` is a separate authenticated agent workspace with conversation search/status filters, saved transcript, quick-action history, assignment, status changes and replies.
- `supabase/migrations/202610220001_support_chat.sql` creates the support tables, RLS policies, message activity trigger and Realtime publication entries.
- `supabase/migrations/202610220002_support_rate_limits.sql` limits customer messages to 8/minute, quick-action events to 30/minute and keeps one open/pending thread per anonymous visitor.
- `supabase/migrations/202610220003_private_agent_helper.sql` moves the `SECURITY DEFINER` helper out of the exposed `public` schema and adds foreign-key indexes.
- `supabase/migrations/202610220004_agent_policy_tighten.sql` stops non-agent users from probing the support-agent allow-list.
- `site-footer-config.js` contains only the Supabase project URL and publishable key. It does not contain a service-role or secret key.

All four migrations have been applied to the existing Free Supabase project. Customer/agent access is enforced by RLS; visitors must use Supabase anonymous Auth and can only read/write their own conversation. The admin inbox checks the signed-in email against `support_agents` before loading any conversations.

## Required one-time configuration

1. In Supabase Dashboard, open **Authentication → Sign In / Providers** and enable **Anonymous Sign-Ins**. The storefront needs this so visitors can chat without creating an account. See [Supabase Anonymous Sign-Ins](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-anonymous).
2. Create an Auth user for the support administrator (Auth → Users → Add user, or use the Create an account button in the inbox and verify the email if requested).
3. Allow-list the administrator email in SQL Editor. Replace both placeholders first:

   ```sql
   insert into public.support_agents (email, display_name)
   values (lower('ADMIN_EMAIL_HERE'), 'Support Admin')
   on conflict (email) do update
     set display_name = excluded.display_name, active = true;
   ```

4. The admin inbox is at `https://muslimabaya.com/admin-support-inbox.html`. Its password reset page is `/admin-support-reset.html`; a single exact production redirect URL has been added to Supabase Auth so recovery links return to that page.

Anonymous Supabase users are persistent Auth records and Supabase does not automatically clean them up. Supabase recommends CAPTCHA/Cloudflare Turnstile for abuse prevention. This project has database-side chat/event rate limits, but Turnstile is not configured yet. Decide the support-chat retention period and configure CAPTCHA before broad public launch; do not expose an Auth secret/service-role key in the website.

Never put the Supabase service-role key in a browser file. The publishable key is public and relies on the RLS policies applied in the migrations.

## Order status behaviour

The **Order status** action now calls the `order-status` Supabase Edge Function. It requires a signed-in anonymous visitor session, Turnstile verification, and the configured Apps Script `OrderTrack` endpoint. It returns only order ID/date/status/tracking fields and does not store submitted phone/order IDs in the chat log. If required Edge Function secrets or Supabase Auth CAPTCHA configuration are missing, lookup is not fully operational. Never ask customers to post payment-card details or passwords in chat.

Customer replies are stored when sent, but there is no email/SMS notification yet. Realtime delivery is for currently connected storefront and inbox sessions; visitors who clear browser storage or switch devices may not be able to recover their anonymous thread.

## Free-plan note

Supabase Free includes Realtime and Edge Function quotas, but the project can pause after a week of low activity and has no uptime SLA. If it pauses, an owner must restore it from Supabase Dashboard. Monitor database size, Realtime messages and connections against the Free plan quotas.


## Admin inbox access and testing

After the feature branch is merged and the site is deployed, open `https://muslimabaya.com/admin-support-inbox.html`. Locally, serve the repository root with `python3 -m http.server 8000` and open `http://localhost:8000/admin-support-inbox.html`; the live Supabase backend still needs to be reachable. Sign in with an approved Supabase Auth email/password account. To test a new agent, create the account in the inbox, complete email verification if enabled, then have the project owner add that email to `public.support_agents` with `active = true`. Never store or share the inbox password in documentation or chat.

For chat testing after deployment, open the storefront in a private/incognito session, open Customer Support, complete the Turnstile prompt if shown, and send a harmless test message. In a second browser session, sign in to the admin inbox and verify that the conversation appears and replies arrive in real time. Test the Order status action with a known test order ID and the exact phone number used for that order. Confirm that a wrong ID/phone pair reveals no order details. The widget asks for both values and does not store them in the chat message/event log.

## Order lookup and Turnstile rollout

`supabase/functions/order-status/index.ts` is deployed as `order-status` with JWT verification enabled. It reads `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` and `ORDER_TRACK_API_URL` from the Edge Function runtime using `Deno.env.get(...)`; it never reads a secret from browser code. Each lookup is verified by Cloudflare Turnstile for action `order_status` and hostname `muslimabaya.com`, then proxied to the Apps Script `OrderTrack` route. The response is limited to order ID, date, status, courier status, and tracking value.

### Add the Edge Function secret

1. In Cloudflare Turnstile, open the widget for `muslimabaya.com` and copy its **Secret key**. Do not use the **Site key** in this step.
2. Open the Supabase project → **Edge Functions** → **Secrets**.
3. Add a secret with the exact name `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` and paste the Cloudflare **Secret key** only into the Supabase **Value** field. Save it.
4. Verify the name appears in the Custom secrets list. The dashboard intentionally does not show the saved value. Never paste this key into `support-chat.js`, `site-footer-config.js`, GitHub, logs, or chat.
5. Keep the other required settings present: `ORDER_TRACK_API_URL` (the Apps Script `OrderTrack` web app URL) and `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://muslimabaya.com`.

The function code checks for missing configuration. It now logs missing variable **names only**; it never logs values. If `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` or `ORDER_TRACK_API_URL` is absent or blank, the request returns `FUNCTION_NOT_CONFIGURED` (HTTP 500). Adding a Supabase Function secret does not require placing or committing the key in source code.

### Configure Supabase Auth CAPTCHA separately

The Edge Function secret and Supabase Auth's CAPTCHA setting are separate configuration surfaces. In Supabase **Authentication → Attack Protection**, enable **CAPTCHA protection**, select Cloudflare Turnstile, enter the widget's Site key and Secret key in the Auth settings, and save. Keep Anonymous Sign-Ins enabled for storefront chat. Only the public Site key may be in `site-footer-config.js`; the Secret key must stay server-side.

### Verify the setup

- Confirm `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`, `ORDER_TRACK_API_URL`, and `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` are listed under Supabase Edge Function Custom secrets; check names only, never reveal values.
- Confirm Supabase Auth Attack Protection shows CAPTCHA protection enabled and Cloudflare Turnstile selected.
- Submit a Turnstile-backed lookup using a designated test order ID and its matching test phone. A missing server secret returns `FUNCTION_NOT_CONFIGURED`; a missing token returns `CAPTCHA_REQUIRED`; an invalid, wrong-action, or wrong-host token returns `CAPTCHA_FAILED`.
- The deployed `order-status` source enforces `verify_jwt=true`. Do not disable JWT verification or store the Turnstile Secret key in the frontend.

Until the server-side secret and Auth CAPTCHA are configured, lookup is not fully operational. Do not publish or paste secret keys in source or chat.


## Admin inbox alerts

In the admin inbox, select **Enable alerts** to grant this browser permission for desktop notifications; browsers require this user gesture. Select **Sound: Off** to enable/disable the short sound. Alerts are generated only for new customer messages while the inbox page is open and subscribed; this is not a background push service and does not alert if the tab/browser is closed or Realtime is disconnected. Browser notification permissions may also be blocked by OS/browser settings.


## Admin password recovery

`admin-support-reset.html` implements Supabase Auth recovery. It requests a recovery email with the exact production redirect `https://muslimabaya.com/admin-support-reset.html`, displays a generic response that does not reveal whether an email exists, and only exposes the new-password form after a valid recovery session. The new password is sent through `supabase.auth.updateUser`; no service-role key or custom password storage is used. Supabase Auth URL Configuration must continue to allow this exact redirect. The existing general `forgot-password.html` page is not used by Admin Inbox.

## Admin inbox alerts code

The full, copyable browser notification and sound integration is documented in [`ADMIN-INBOX-ALERTS-CODE-BN.md`](ADMIN-INBOX-ALERTS-CODE-BN.md) and runs in `admin-support-inbox.html`. It is opt-in and requires the agent's inbox tab to remain open and Realtime-connected; it is not a push-notification service.
